description: A classic of travel writing, In Morocco is Edith Wharton's remarkable
  account of her journey to the country during World War I. With a characteristic
  sense of adventure, Wharton set out to explore Morocco and its people, recording
  her impressions and encounters. She traveled--by military jeep--to Rabat, Moulay
  Idriss, Fex and Marrakech, from the Atlantic coast to the high Atlas. Along the
  way she witnessed religious ceremonies and ritual dances, visited the opulent palaces
  of the Sultan and was admitted to the mysterious world of his harem. Her narrative
  is as rich as the souks through which she wandered, peopled with story-tellers and
  warriors, slaves and silk-spinners; an evocative and intimate portrait of an extraordinary
  country.
